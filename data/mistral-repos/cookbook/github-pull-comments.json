It is critical to manage it effectively to reduce your security risk.\r\n\r\n## Detect and block open source supply chain attacks\r\n\r\nSecurity teams depend on Socket to prevent malicious open source dependencies from infiltrating their apps.\r\n\r\nSocket dramatically improves your open source security posture by _detecting and blocking the attacks you don't expect_ \u2013 malware, install scripts, hidden code, typo-squatting, and more \u2013 which aren't caught by traditional vulnerability scanners.\r\n\r\n- **Block malware** \u2013 Block emerging malware threats\r\n\r\n- **Block typo-squatting** \u2013 Block malicious packages that differ in name by only a few characters, and recommend the correct package\r\n\r\n- **Detect hidden code** \u2013 Detect obfuscated, minified, or hidden code\r\n\r\n- **Detect privileged API usage** \u2013 Report when a dependency update introduces new risky API usage \u2013 filesystem, network, child_process, eval()\r\n\r\n- **Detect suspicious updates** \u2013 Sudden inclusion of privileged APIs in patch or minor releases\r\n\r\nSocket currently [supports 60 detections](https://socket.dev/npm/issue) in 5 categories: supply chain risk, quality, maintenance, known vulnerabilities, and license problems.\r\n\r\n## Take charge of your dependency health\r\n\r\nSocket improves security outcomes and reduces work for security teams by **surfacing actionable security information directly inline in GitHub** so developers are empowered to make better decisions.\r\n\r\n- **Five minute deployment** \u2013 The easiest security product you'll ever deploy in your organization. Just install a GitHub app and you're done.\r\n\r\n- **Provide security feedback directly on PRs** \u2013 Empower developers to solve security issues before they're deployed into production.\r\n\r\n- **Automated security** \u2013 Spend security team resources auditing the highest-impact dependencies, instead of all or nothing.\r\n\r\n## Socket detects what vulnerability scanners can\u2019t\r\n\r\nIt's no longer sufficient to scan for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and stop there. And yet, that's what the leading \"supply chain security\" products do, leaving you vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIt can take weeks or months for a CVE to be discovered, reported, and detected by tools. But in today's culture of fast development, a malicious dependency can be updated, merged, and running in production in days or even sometimes hours.\r\n\r\nDefenders need a new approach to address emerging threats from malicious dependencies:\r\n\r\n- **Maintainer intentionally added malware** \u2013 Rogue maintainer sabotaged his own open source package with 100M downloads/month, affecting companies such as Amazon AWS\r\n\r\n- **Package hijacked and poisoned w/ cryptominers and password-stealing malware** \u2013 Deliberate malware introduced into multiple packages with 30M downloads/month each\r\n\r\n- **Package hijacked to add backdoor targeting a specific organization** \u2013 Obfuscated malware added to a dependency which targeted a single company, went undetected for over a week, and made it into their production build\r\n\r\n- **NPM package manager allowed anyone to publish new versions of any package** \u2013 Attackers could publish new versions of any NPM package without authorization _for multiple years_\r\n\r\nUsing third-party dependencies without proper vetting leaves you open to hacking, breaches, and assorted security misfortune.",

It is critical to manage it effectively to reduce your security risk.\r\n\r\n## Detect and block open source supply chain attacks\r\n\r\nSecurity teams depend on Socket to prevent malicious open source dependencies from infiltrating their apps.\r\n\r\nSocket dramatically improves your open source security posture by _detecting and blocking the attacks you don't expect_ \u2013 malware, install scripts, hidden code, typo-squatting, and more \u2013 which aren't caught by traditional vulnerability scanners.\r\n\r\n- **Block malware** \u2013 Block emerging malware threats\r\n\r\n- **Block typo-squatting** \u2013 Block malicious packages that differ in name by only a few characters, and recommend the correct package\r\n\r\n- **Detect hidden code** \u2013 Detect obfuscated, minified, or hidden code\r\n\r\n- **Detect privileged API usage** \u2013 Report when a dependency update introduces new risky API usage \u2013 filesystem, network, child_process, eval()\r\n\r\n- **Detect suspicious updates** \u2013 Sudden inclusion of privileged APIs in patch or minor releases\r\n\r\nSocket currently [supports 60 detections](https://socket.dev/npm/issue) in 5 categories: supply chain risk, quality, maintenance, known vulnerabilities, and license problems.\r\n\r\n## Take charge of your dependency health\r\n\r\nSocket improves security outcomes and reduces work for security teams by **surfacing actionable security information directly inline in GitHub** so developers are empowered to make better decisions.\r\n\r\n- **Five minute deployment** \u2013 The easiest security product you'll ever deploy in your organization. Just install a GitHub app and you're done.\r\n\r\n- **Provide security feedback directly on PRs** \u2013 Empower developers to solve security issues before they're deployed into production.\r\n\r\n- **Automated security** \u2013 Spend security team resources auditing the highest-impact dependencies, instead of all or nothing.\r\n\r\n## Socket detects what vulnerability scanners can\u2019t\r\n\r\nIt's no longer sufficient to scan for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and stop there. And yet, that's what the leading \"supply chain security\" products do, leaving you vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIt can take weeks or months for a CVE to be discovered, reported, and detected by tools. But in today's culture of fast development, a malicious dependency can be updated, merged, and running in production in days or even sometimes hours.\r\n\r\nDefenders need a new approach to address emerging threats from malicious dependencies:\r\n\r\n- **Maintainer intentionally added malware** \u2013 Rogue maintainer sabotaged his own open source package with 100M downloads/month, affecting companies such as Amazon AWS\r\n\r\n- **Package hijacked and poisoned w/ cryptominers and password-stealing malware** \u2013 Deliberate malware introduced into multiple packages with 30M downloads/month each\r\n\r\n- **Package hijacked to add backdoor targeting a specific organization** \u2013 Obfuscated malware added to a dependency which targeted a single company, went undetected for over a week, and made it into their production build\r\n\r\n- **NPM package manager allowed anyone to publish new versions of any package** \u2013 Attackers could publish new versions of any NPM package without authorization _for multiple years_\r\n\r\nUsing third-party dependencies without proper vetting leaves you open to hacking, breaches, and assorted security misfortune.",

We need to implement some basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)!\n+\n+For this task, we require `faiss` and `PyPDF2`. Let's import them:\n+```py\n+pip install PyPDF2 faiss\n+```\n+\n+**For CPU only please install faiss-cpu instead.**\n+\n+This demo uses `PyPDF2===3.0.1` and `faiss-cpu===1.8.0`\n+```py\n+import io\n+import solara as sl\n+from mistralai.client import MistralClient\n+import numpy as np\n+import PyPDF2\n+import faiss\n+```\n+\n+Now, we need to add the possibility to upload PDF files. For this, let's use `FileDropMultiple` from `solara`. The PDFs will then be stored in a new reactive variable:\n+\n+```py\n+from solara.components.file_drop import FileInfo\n+\n+content, set_content = sl.use_state(cast(List[bytes], []))\n+\n+def on_file(files: List[FileInfo]):\n+    set_content([file[\"file_obj\"].read() for file in files])\n+\n+sl.FileDropMultiple(\n+    label=\"Drag and drop your PDF file(s) here.\",\n+    on_file=on_file,\n+    lazy=True,\n+)\n+```\n+\n+The PDFs are stored, but as they are, we just have a large amount of bytes. To be able to chat with the PDF, we will need to extract the text:\n+```py\n+txt = sl.use_reactive(cast(List[str], []))\n+\n+def get_text():\n+    txt_all = []\n+    for _content in content:\n+        bytes_io = io.BytesIO(_content)\n+        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(bytes_io)\n+        txt_aux = \"\"\n+        for page in reader.pages:\n+            txt_aux += page.extract_text()\n+        txt_all.append(txt_aux)\n+    return txt_all\n+\n+if content:\n+    sl.Info(\"File(s) has been uploaded. Showing the beginning of the file(s)...\")\n+    result: Task[List[str]] = use_task(get_text, dependencies=[content])\n+    if result.finished:\n+        txt.value = result.value\n+    sl.ProgressLinear(result.pending)\n+    for text in txt.value:\n+        sl.Markdown(f\"{text[:100]}\")\n+```\n+\n+Now that we have the texts, let's use Mistral's embeddings to retrieve the relevant chunks. First, let's define a function that converts text to embeddings with Mistral:\n+\n+```py\n+def get_text_embedding(input_text: str):\n+    embeddings_batch_response = client.embeddings(\n+          model = \"mistral-embed\",\n+          input = input_text\n+      )\n+    return embeddings_batch_response.data[0].embedding\n+```\n+\n+Next, we can declare a function that will handle all the retrieval part. This step will make use of `faiss` for the vector store and the previously created `get_text_embedding function`. This will cut the different files into chunks, create the embeddings, and retrieve the best 4 chunks among them, which will then be concatenated into a single string:\n+\n+```py\n+def rag_pdf(txt: List[str], question: str) -> str:\n+    chunk_size = 1024\n+    chunks = []\n+    for _txt in txt:\n+        chunks += [_txt[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(_txt), chunk_size)]\n+\n+    text_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(chunk) for chunk in chunks])\n+    d = text_embeddings.shape[1]\n+    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)\n+    index.add(text_embeddings)\n+\n+    question_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(question)])\n+    D, I = index.search(question_embeddings, k = 3)\n+    retrieved_chunk = [chunks[i] for i in I.tolist()[0]]\n+    text_retrieved = \"\\n\\n\".join(retrieved_chunk)\n+    return text_retrieved\n+```\n+\n+Finally, we edit `response_generator` to implement our new RAG with the files! This function, when there are PDFs, will extract the text with PyPDF2 and make use of `rag_pdf` to retrieve the relevant data. It will only then send the request to the model:\n+\n+```py\n+def response_generator(messages: list, txt: List[str]):\n+    response = client.chat_stream(\n+        model = \"open-mistral-7b\",\n+        messages = messages[:-1] + [{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\": rag_pdf(txt, messages[-1][\"content\"]) + \"\\n\\n\" + messages[-1][\"content\"]}],\n+        max_tokens = 1024\n+    )\n+    for chunk in response:\n+        yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content\n+```\n+\n+And everything is done!

We need to implement some basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)!\n+\n+For this task, we require `faiss` and `PyPDF2`. Let's import them:\n+```py\n+pip install PyPDF2 faiss\n+```\n+\n+**For CPU only please install faiss-cpu instead.**\n+\n+This demo uses `PyPDF2===3.0.1` and `faiss-cpu===1.8.0`\n+```py\n+import io\n+import solara as sl\n+from mistralai.client import MistralClient\n+import numpy as np\n+import PyPDF2\n+import faiss\n+```\n+\n+Now, we need to add the possibility to upload PDF files. For this, let's use `FileDropMultiple` from `solara`. The PDFs will then be stored in a new reactive variable:\n+\n+```py\n+from solara.components.file_drop import FileInfo\n+\n+content, set_content = sl.use_state(cast(List[bytes], []))\n+\n+def on_file(files: List[FileInfo]):\n+    set_content([file[\"file_obj\"].read() for file in files])\n+\n+sl.FileDropMultiple(\n+    label=\"Drag and drop your PDF file(s) here.\",\n+    on_file=on_file,\n+    lazy=True,\n+)\n+```\n+\n+The PDFs are stored, but as they are, we just have a large amount of bytes. To be able to chat with the PDF, we will need to extract the text:\n+```py\n+txt = sl.use_reactive(cast(List[str], []))\n+\n+def get_text():\n+    txt_all = []\n+    for _content in content:\n+        bytes_io = io.BytesIO(_content)\n+        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(bytes_io)\n+        txt_aux = \"\"\n+        for page in reader.pages:\n+            txt_aux += page.extract_text()\n+        txt_all.append(txt_aux)\n+    return txt_all\n+\n+if content:\n+    sl.Info(\"File(s) has been uploaded. Showing the beginning of the file(s)...\")\n+    result: Task[List[str]] = use_task(get_text, dependencies=[content])\n+    if result.finished:\n+        txt.value = result.value\n+    sl.ProgressLinear(result.pending)\n+    for text in txt.value:\n+        sl.Markdown(f\"{text[:100]}\")\n+```\n+\n+Now that we have the texts, let's use Mistral's embeddings to retrieve the relevant chunks. First, let's define a function that converts text to embeddings with Mistral:\n+\n+```py\n+def get_text_embedding(input_text: str):\n+    embeddings_batch_response = client.embeddings(\n+          model = \"mistral-embed\",\n+          input = input_text\n+      )\n+    return embeddings_batch_response.data[0].embedding\n+```\n+\n+Next, we can declare a function that will handle all the retrieval part. This step will make use of `faiss` for the vector store and the previously created `get_text_embedding function`. This will cut the different files into chunks, create the embeddings, and retrieve the best 4 chunks among them, which will then be concatenated into a single string:\n+\n+```py\n+def rag_pdf(txt: List[str], question: str) -> str:\n+    chunk_size = 1024\n+    chunks = []\n+    for _txt in txt:\n+        chunks += [_txt[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(_txt), chunk_size)]\n+\n+    text_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(chunk) for chunk in chunks])\n+    d = text_embeddings.shape[1]\n+    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)\n+    index.add(text_embeddings)\n+\n+    question_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(question)])\n+    D, I = index.search(question_embeddings, k = 3)\n+    retrieved_chunk = [chunks[i] for i in I.tolist()[0]]\n+    text_retrieved = \"\\n\\n\".join(retrieved_chunk)\n+    return text_retrieved\n+```\n+\n+Finally, we edit `response_generator` to implement our new RAG with the files! This function, when there are PDFs, will extract the text with PyPDF2 and make use of `rag_pdf` to retrieve the relevant data. It will only then send the request to the model:\n+\n+```py\n+def response_generator(messages: list, txt: List[str]):\n+    response = client.chat_stream(\n+        model = \"open-mistral-7b\",\n+        messages = messages[:-1] + [{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\": rag_pdf(txt, messages[-1][\"content\"]) + \"\\n\\n\" + messages[-1][\"content\"]}],\n+        max_tokens = 1024\n+    )\n+    for chunk in response:\n+        yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content\n+```\n+\n+And everything is done!

We need to implement some basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)!\n+\n+For this task, we require `faiss` and `PyPDF2`. Let's import them:\n+```py\n+pip install PyPDF2 faiss\n+```\n+\n+**For CPU only please install faiss-cpu instead.**\n+\n+This demo uses `PyPDF2===3.0.1` and `faiss-cpu===1.8.0`\n+```py\n+import io\n+import solara as sl\n+from mistralai.client import MistralClient\n+import numpy as np\n+import PyPDF2\n+import faiss\n+```\n+\n+Now, we need to add the possibility to upload PDF files. For this, let's use `FileDropMultiple` from `solara`. The PDFs will then be stored in a new reactive variable:\n+\n+```py\n+from solara.components.file_drop import FileInfo\n+\n+content, set_content = sl.use_state(cast(List[bytes], []))\n+\n+def on_file(files: List[FileInfo]):\n+    set_content([file[\"file_obj\"].read() for file in files])\n+\n+sl.FileDropMultiple(\n+    label=\"Drag and drop your PDF file(s) here.\",\n+    on_file=on_file,\n+    lazy=True,\n+)\n+```\n+\n+The PDFs are stored, but as they are, we just have a large amount of bytes. To be able to chat with the PDF, we will need to extract the text:\n+```py\n+txt = sl.use_reactive(cast(List[str], []))\n+\n+def get_text():\n+    txt_all = []\n+    for _content in content:\n+        bytes_io = io.BytesIO(_content)\n+        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(bytes_io)\n+        txt_aux = \"\"\n+        for page in reader.pages:\n+            txt_aux += page.extract_text()\n+        txt_all.append(txt_aux)\n+    return txt_all\n+\n+if content:\n+    sl.Info(\"File(s) has been uploaded. Showing the beginning of the file(s)...\")\n+    result: Task[List[str]] = use_task(get_text, dependencies=[content])\n+    if result.finished:\n+        txt.value = result.value\n+    sl.ProgressLinear(result.pending)\n+    for text in txt.value:\n+        sl.Markdown(f\"{text[:100]}\")\n+```\n+\n+Now that we have the texts, let's use Mistral's embeddings to retrieve the relevant chunks. First, let's define a function that converts text to embeddings with Mistral:\n+\n+```py\n+def get_text_embedding(input_text: str):\n+    embeddings_batch_response = client.embeddings(\n+          model = \"mistral-embed\",\n+          input = input_text\n+      )\n+    return embeddings_batch_response.data[0].embedding\n+```\n+\n+Next, we can declare a function that will handle all the retrieval part. This step will make use of `faiss` for the vector store and the previously created `get_text_embedding function`. This will cut the different files into chunks, create the embeddings, and retrieve the best 4 chunks among them, which will then be concatenated into a single string:\n+\n+```py\n+def rag_pdf(txt: List[str], question: str) -> str:\n+    chunk_size = 1024\n+    chunks = []\n+    for _txt in txt:\n+        chunks += [_txt[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(_txt), chunk_size)]\n+\n+    text_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(chunk) for chunk in chunks])\n+    d = text_embeddings.shape[1]\n+    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)\n+    index.add(text_embeddings)\n+\n+    question_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(question)])\n+    D, I = index.search(question_embeddings, k = 3)\n+    retrieved_chunk = [chunks[i] for i in I.tolist()[0]]\n+    text_retrieved = \"\\n\\n\".join(retrieved_chunk)\n+    return text_retrieved\n+```\n+\n+Finally, we edit `response_generator` to implement our new RAG with the files! This function, when there are PDFs, will extract the text with PyPDF2 and make use of `rag_pdf` to retrieve the relevant data. It will only then send the request to the model:\n+\n+```py\n+def response_generator(messages: list, txt: List[str]):\n+    response = client.chat_stream(\n+        model = \"open-mistral-7b\",\n+        messages = messages[:-1] + [{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\": rag_pdf(txt, messages[-1][\"content\"]) + \"\\n\\n\" + messages[-1][\"content\"]}],\n+        max_tokens = 1024\n+    )\n+    for chunk in response:\n+        yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content\n+```\n+\n+And everything is done!

We need to implement some basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)!\n+\n+For this task, we require `faiss` and `PyPDF2`. Let's import them:\n+```py\n+pip install PyPDF2 faiss\n+```\n+\n+**For CPU only please install faiss-cpu instead.**\n+\n+This demo uses `PyPDF2===3.0.1` and `faiss-cpu===1.8.0`\n+```py\n+import io\n+import solara as sl\n+from mistralai.client import MistralClient\n+import numpy as np\n+import PyPDF2\n+import faiss\n+```\n+\n+Now, we need to add the possibility to upload PDF files. For this, let's use `FileDropMultiple` from `solara`. The PDFs will then be stored in a new reactive variable:\n+\n+```py\n+from solara.components.file_drop import FileInfo\n+\n+content, set_content = sl.use_state(cast(List[bytes], []))\n+\n+def on_file(files: List[FileInfo]):\n+    set_content([file[\"file_obj\"].read() for file in files])\n+\n+sl.FileDropMultiple(\n+    label=\"Drag and drop your PDF file(s) here.\",\n+    on_file=on_file,\n+    lazy=True,\n+)\n+```\n+\n+The PDFs are stored, but as they are, we just have a large amount of bytes. To be able to chat with the PDF, we will need to extract the text:\n+```py\n+txt = sl.use_reactive(cast(List[str], []))\n+\n+def get_text():\n+    txt_all = []\n+    for _content in content:\n+        bytes_io = io.BytesIO(_content)\n+        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(bytes_io)\n+        txt_aux = \"\"\n+        for page in reader.pages:\n+            txt_aux += page.extract_text()\n+        txt_all.append(txt_aux)\n+    return txt_all\n+\n+if content:\n+    sl.Info(\"File(s) has been uploaded. Showing the beginning of the file(s)...\")\n+    result: Task[List[str]] = use_task(get_text, dependencies=[content])\n+    if result.finished:\n+        txt.value = result.value\n+    sl.ProgressLinear(result.pending)\n+    for text in txt.value:\n+        sl.Markdown(f\"{text[:100]}\")\n+```\n+\n+Now that we have the texts, let's use Mistral's embeddings to retrieve the relevant chunks. First, let's define a function that converts text to embeddings with Mistral:\n+\n+```py\n+def get_text_embedding(input_text: str):\n+    embeddings_batch_response = client.embeddings(\n+          model = \"mistral-embed\",\n+          input = input_text\n+      )\n+    return embeddings_batch_response.data[0].embedding\n+```\n+\n+Next, we can declare a function that will handle all the retrieval part. This step will make use of `faiss` for the vector store and the previously created `get_text_embedding function`. This will cut the different files into chunks, create the embeddings, and retrieve the best 4 chunks among them, which will then be concatenated into a single string:\n+\n+```py\n+def rag_pdf(txt: List[str], question: str) -> str:\n+    chunk_size = 1024\n+    chunks = []\n+    for _txt in txt:\n+        chunks += [_txt[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(_txt), chunk_size)]\n+\n+    text_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(chunk) for chunk in chunks])\n+    d = text_embeddings.shape[1]\n+    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)\n+    index.add(text_embeddings)\n+\n+    question_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(question)])\n+    D, I = index.search(question_embeddings, k = 3)\n+    retrieved_chunk = [chunks[i] for i in I.tolist()[0]]\n+    text_retrieved = \"\\n\\n\".join(retrieved_chunk)\n+    return text_retrieved\n+```\n+\n+Finally, we edit `response_generator` to implement our new RAG with the files! This function, when there are PDFs, will extract the text with PyPDF2 and make use of `rag_pdf` to retrieve the relevant data. It will only then send the request to the model:\n+\n+```py\n+def response_generator(messages: list, txt: List[str]):\n+    response = client.chat_stream(\n+        model = \"open-mistral-7b\",\n+        messages = messages[:-1] + [{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\": rag_pdf(txt, messages[-1][\"content\"]) + \"\\n\\n\" + messages[-1][\"content\"]}],\n+        max_tokens = 1024\n+    )\n+    for chunk in response:\n+        yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content\n+```\n+\n+And everything is done!

We need to implement some basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)!\n+\n+For this task, we require `faiss` and `PyPDF2`. Let's import them:\n+```py\n+pip install PyPDF2 faiss\n+```\n+\n+**For CPU only please install faiss-cpu instead.**\n+\n+This demo uses `PyPDF2===3.0.1` and `faiss-cpu===1.8.0`\n+```py\n+import io\n+import solara as sl\n+from mistralai.client import MistralClient\n+import numpy as np\n+import PyPDF2\n+import faiss\n+```\n+\n+Now, we need to add the possibility to upload PDF files. For this, let's use `FileDropMultiple` from `solara`. The PDFs will then be stored in a new reactive variable:\n+\n+```py\n+from solara.components.file_drop import FileInfo\n+\n+content, set_content = sl.use_state(cast(List[bytes], []))\n+\n+def on_file(files: List[FileInfo]):\n+    set_content([file[\"file_obj\"].read() for file in files])\n+\n+sl.FileDropMultiple(\n+    label=\"Drag and drop your PDF file(s) here.\",\n+    on_file=on_file,\n+    lazy=True,\n+)\n+```\n+\n+The PDFs are stored, but as they are, we just have a large amount of bytes. To be able to chat with the PDF, we will need to extract the text:\n+```py\n+txt = sl.use_reactive(cast(List[str], []))\n+\n+def get_text():\n+    txt_all = []\n+    for _content in content:\n+        bytes_io = io.BytesIO(_content)\n+        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(bytes_io)\n+        txt_aux = \"\"\n+        for page in reader.pages:\n+            txt_aux += page.extract_text()\n+        txt_all.append(txt_aux)\n+    return txt_all\n+\n+if content:\n+    sl.Info(\"File(s) has been uploaded.

First, let's define a function that converts text to embeddings with Mistral:\n+\n+```py\n+def get_text_embedding(input_text: str):\n+    embeddings_batch_response = client.embeddings(\n+          model = \"mistral-embed\",\n+          input = input_text\n+      )\n+    return embeddings_batch_response.data[0].embedding\n+```\n+\n+Next, we can declare a function that will handle all the retrieval part. This step will make use of `faiss` for the vector store and the previously created `get_text_embedding function`. This will cut the different files into chunks, create the embeddings, and retrieve the best 4 chunks among them, which will then be concatenated into a single string:\n+\n+```py\n+def rag_pdf(txt: List[str], question: str) -> str:\n+    chunk_size = 1024\n+    chunks = []\n+    for _txt in txt:\n+        chunks += [_txt[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(_txt), chunk_size)]\n+\n+    text_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(chunk) for chunk in chunks])\n+    d = text_embeddings.shape[1]\n+    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)\n+    index.add(text_embeddings)\n+\n+    question_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(question)])\n+    D, I = index.search(question_embeddings, k = 3)\n+    retrieved_chunk = [chunks[i] for i in I.tolist()[0]]\n+    text_retrieved = \"\\n\\n\".join(retrieved_chunk)\n+    return text_retrieved\n+```\n+\n+Finally, we edit `response_generator` to implement our new RAG with the files! This function, when there are PDFs, will extract the text with PyPDF2 and make use of `rag_pdf` to retrieve the relevant data. It will only then send the request to the model:\n+\n+```py\n+def response_generator(messages: list, txt: List[str]):\n+    response = client.chat_stream(\n+        model = \"open-mistral-7b\",\n+        messages = messages[:-1] + [{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\": rag_pdf(txt, messages[-1][\"content\"]) + \"\\n\\n\" + messages[-1][\"content\"]}],\n+        max_tokens = 1024\n+    )\n+    for chunk in response:\n+        yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content\n+```\n+\n+And everything is done!

To be able to chat with the PDF, we will need to extract the text:\n+```py\n+txt = sl.use_reactive(cast(List[str], []))\n+\n+def get_text():\n+    txt_all = []\n+    for _content in content:\n+        bytes_io = io.BytesIO(_content)\n+        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(bytes_io)\n+        txt_aux = \"\"\n+        for page in reader.pages:\n+            txt_aux += page.extract_text()\n+        txt_all.append(txt_aux)\n+    return txt_all\n+\n+if content:\n+    sl.Info(\"File(s) has been uploaded. Showing the beginning of the file(s)...\")\n+    result: Task[List[str]] = use_task(get_text, dependencies=[content])\n+    if result.finished:\n+        txt.value = result.value\n+    sl.ProgressLinear(result.pending)\n+    for text in txt.value:\n+        sl.Markdown(f\"{text[:100]}\")\n+```\n+\n+Now that we have the texts, let's use Mistral's embeddings to retrieve the relevant chunks. First, let's define a function that converts text to embeddings with Mistral:\n+\n+```py\n+def get_text_embedding(input_text: str):\n+    embeddings_batch_response = client.embeddings(\n+          model = \"mistral-embed\",\n+          input = input_text\n+      )\n+    return embeddings_batch_response.data[0].embedding\n+```\n+\n+Next, we can declare a function that will handle all the retrieval part. This step will make use of `faiss` for the vector store and the previously created `get_text_embedding function`. This will cut the different files into chunks, create the embeddings, and retrieve the best 4 chunks among them, which will then be concatenated into a single string:\n+\n+```py\n+def rag_pdf(txt: List[str], question: str) -> str:\n+    chunk_size = 1024\n+    chunks = []\n+    for _txt in txt:\n+        chunks += [_txt[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(_txt), chunk_size)]\n+\n+    text_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(chunk) for chunk in chunks])\n+    d = text_embeddings.shape[1]\n+    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)\n+    index.add(text_embeddings)\n+\n+    question_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(question)])\n+    D, I = index.search(question_embeddings, k = 3)\n+    retrieved_chunk = [chunks[i] for i in I.tolist()[0]]\n+    text_retrieved = \"\\n\\n\".join(retrieved_chunk)\n+    return text_retrieved\n+```\n+\n+Finally, we edit `response_generator` to implement our new RAG with the files! This function, when there are PDFs, will extract the text with PyPDF2 and make use of `rag_pdf` to retrieve the relevant data. It will only then send the request to the model:\n+\n+```py\n+def response_generator(messages: list, txt: List[str]):\n+    response = client.chat_stream(\n+        model = \"open-mistral-7b\",\n+        messages = messages[:-1] + [{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\": rag_pdf(txt, messages[-1][\"content\"]) + \"\\n\\n\" + messages[-1][\"content\"]}],\n+        max_tokens = 1024\n+    )\n+    for chunk in response:\n+        yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content\n+```\n+\n+And everything is done!

This will cut the different files into chunks, create the embeddings, and retrieve the best 4 chunks among them, which will then be concatenated into a single string:\n+\n+```py\n+def rag_pdf(txt: List[str], question: str) -> str:\n+    chunk_size = 1024\n+    chunks = []\n+    for _txt in txt:\n+        chunks += [_txt[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(_txt), chunk_size)]\n+\n+    text_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(chunk) for chunk in chunks])\n+    d = text_embeddings.shape[1]\n+    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)\n+    index.add(text_embeddings)\n+\n+    question_embeddings = np.array([get_text_embedding(question)])\n+    D, I = index.search(question_embeddings, k = 3)\n+    retrieved_chunk = [chunks[i] for i in I.tolist()[0]]\n+    text_retrieved = \"\\n\\n\".join(retrieved_chunk)\n+    return text_retrieved\n+```\n+\n+Finally, we edit `response_generator` to implement our new RAG with the files! This function, when there are PDFs, will extract the text with PyPDF2 and make use of `rag_pdf` to retrieve the relevant data. It will only then send the request to the model:\n+\n+```py\n+def response_generator(messages: list, txt: List[str]):\n+    response = client.chat_stream(\n+        model = \"open-mistral-7b\",\n+        messages = messages[:-1] + [{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\": rag_pdf(txt, messages[-1][\"content\"]) + \"\\n\\n\" + messages[-1][\"content\"]}],\n+        max_tokens = 1024\n+    )\n+    for chunk in response:\n+        yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content\n+```\n+\n+And everything is done!

It is critical to manage it effectively to reduce your security risk.\r\n\r\n## Detect and block open source supply chain attacks\r\n\r\nSecurity teams depend on Socket to prevent malicious open source dependencies from infiltrating their apps.\r\n\r\nSocket dramatically improves your open source security posture by _detecting and blocking the attacks you don't expect_ \u2013 malware, install scripts, hidden code, typo-squatting, and more \u2013 which aren't caught by traditional vulnerability scanners.\r\n\r\n- **Block malware** \u2013 Block emerging malware threats\r\n\r\n- **Block typo-squatting** \u2013 Block malicious packages that differ in name by only a few characters, and recommend the correct package\r\n\r\n- **Detect hidden code** \u2013 Detect obfuscated, minified, or hidden code\r\n\r\n- **Detect privileged API usage** \u2013 Report when a dependency update introduces new risky API usage \u2013 filesystem, network, child_process, eval()\r\n\r\n- **Detect suspicious updates** \u2013 Sudden inclusion of privileged APIs in patch or minor releases\r\n\r\nSocket currently [supports 60 detections](https://socket.dev/npm/issue) in 5 categories: supply chain risk, quality, maintenance, known vulnerabilities, and license problems.\r\n\r\n## Take charge of your dependency health\r\n\r\nSocket improves security outcomes and reduces work for security teams by **surfacing actionable security information directly inline in GitHub** so developers are empowered to make better decisions.\r\n\r\n- **Five minute deployment** \u2013 The easiest security product you'll ever deploy in your organization. Just install a GitHub app and you're done.\r\n\r\n- **Provide security feedback directly on PRs** \u2013 Empower developers to solve security issues before they're deployed into production.\r\n\r\n- **Automated security** \u2013 Spend security team resources auditing the highest-impact dependencies, instead of all or nothing.\r\n\r\n## Socket detects what vulnerability scanners can\u2019t\r\n\r\nIt's no longer sufficient to scan for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and stop there. And yet, that's what the leading \"supply chain security\" products do, leaving you vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIt can take weeks or months for a CVE to be discovered, reported, and detected by tools. But in today's culture of fast development, a malicious dependency can be updated, merged, and running in production in days or even sometimes hours.\r\n\r\nDefenders need a new approach to address emerging threats from malicious dependencies:\r\n\r\n- **Maintainer intentionally added malware** \u2013 Rogue maintainer sabotaged his own open source package with 100M downloads/month, affecting companies such as Amazon AWS\r\n\r\n- **Package hijacked and poisoned w/ cryptominers and password-stealing malware** \u2013 Deliberate malware introduced into multiple packages with 30M downloads/month each\r\n\r\n- **Package hijacked to add backdoor targeting a specific organization** \u2013 Obfuscated malware added to a dependency which targeted a single company, went undetected for over a week, and made it into their production build\r\n\r\n- **NPM package manager allowed anyone to publish new versions of any package** \u2013 Attackers could publish new versions of any NPM package without authorization _for multiple years_\r\n\r\nUsing third-party dependencies without proper vetting leaves you open to hacking, breaches, and assorted security misfortune.",

          "description": "### Socket protects your app from malicious dependencies lurking in your open source supply chain.\r\n\r\nOpen source code makes up 90% of most codebases. It is critical to manage it effectively to reduce your security risk.\r\n\r\n## Detect and block open source supply chain attacks\r\n\r\nSecurity teams depend on Socket to prevent malicious open source dependencies from infiltrating their apps.\r\n\r\nSocket dramatically improves your open source security posture by _detecting and blocking the attacks you don't expect_ \u2013 malware, install scripts, hidden code, typo-squatting, and more \u2013 which aren't caught by traditional vulnerability scanners.\r\n\r\n- **Block malware** \u2013 Block emerging malware threats\r\n\r\n- **Block typo-squatting** \u2013 Block malicious packages that differ in name by only a few characters, and recommend the correct package\r\n\r\n- **Detect hidden code** \u2013 Detect obfuscated, minified, or hidden code\r\n\r\n- **Detect privileged API usage** \u2013 Report when a dependency update introduces new risky API usage \u2013 filesystem, network, child_process, eval()\r\n\r\n- **Detect suspicious updates** \u2013 Sudden inclusion of privileged APIs in patch or minor releases\r\n\r\nSocket currently [supports 60 detections](https://socket.dev/npm/issue) in 5 categories: supply chain risk, quality, maintenance, known vulnerabilities, and license problems.\r\n\r\n## Take charge of your dependency health\r\n\r\nSocket improves security outcomes and reduces work for security teams by **surfacing actionable security information directly inline in GitHub** so developers are empowered to make better decisions.\r\n\r\n- **Five minute deployment** \u2013 The easiest security product you'll ever deploy in your organization. Just install a GitHub app and you're done.\r\n\r\n- **Provide security feedback directly on PRs** \u2013 Empower developers to solve security issues before they're deployed into production.\r\n\r\n- **Automated security** \u2013 Spend security team resources auditing the highest-impact dependencies, instead of all or nothing.\r\n\r\n## Socket detects what vulnerability scanners can\u2019t\r\n\r\nIt's no longer sufficient to scan for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and stop there. And yet, that's what the leading \"supply chain security\" products do, leaving you vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIt can take weeks or months for a CVE to be discovered, reported, and detected by tools. But in today's culture of fast development, a malicious dependency can be updated, merged, and running in production in days or even sometimes hours.\r\n\r\nDefenders need a new approach to address emerging threats from malicious dependencies:\r\n\r\n- **Maintainer intentionally added malware** \u2013 Rogue maintainer sabotaged his own open source package with 100M downloads/month, affecting companies such as Amazon AWS\r\n\r\n- **Package hijacked and poisoned w/ cryptominers and password-stealing malware** \u2013 Deliberate malware introduced into multiple packages with 30M downloads/month each\r\n\r\n- **Package hijacked to add backdoor targeting a specific organization** \u2013 Obfuscated malware added to a dependency which targeted a single company, went undetected for over a week, and made it into their production build\r\n\r\n- **NPM package manager allowed anyone to publish new versions of any package** \u2013 Attackers could publish new versions of any NPM package without authorization _for multiple years_\r\n\r\nUsing third-party dependencies without proper vetting leaves you open to hacking, breaches, and assorted security misfortune.",

For example, OpenHermes 2.5 by Teknium and Neural Chat 7B by Intel.With AI models, open source takes many forms: from available to use locally but no details about the model (weights, architecture etc.) to models that are fully open source and allow users to train on the outputs.While Mistral\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s models were open-weights from the start, Mistral\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99s latest announcement had a line in their Terms of Service Terms of Service which was spotted by Far El on Twitter, said:Basically, you can\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use it to train or improve other models or compete against them\u00e2\\\\x80\u00a6It wasn\u00e2\\\\x80\\\\x99t clear whether this was just for the API platform or the model itself.

Here are the key points:\\\\n\\\\n* The conference took place from June 10 through 14, 2024.\\\\n* It was an online event, but there was a special in-person experience at Apple Park on opening day for developers and students.\\\\n* The conference focused on the latest advancements in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS.\\\\n* iPadOS received new apps like a native calculator, and there were rumors of new Apple Pencil 3 features.\\\\n* macOS offered AI features, with native apps that leaned on smart tools and generative AI: assisted writing in Pages, a slide deck maker in Keynote, coding in Xcode, all powered by AI.\\\\n* The event also included video sessions and opportunities to engage with Apple designers and engineers and connect with the worldwide developer community.\\\\n* Apple supported the next generation of developers through the Swift Student Challenge, with 50 Distinguished Winners being invited to Cupertino for a three-day experience.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, I could not find specific details about the 13 biggest announcements. However, based on the information available, it seems that AI and machine learning played a significant role in the conference.\\\"\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 32,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"messages.append(ChatMessage(role=\\\"tool\\\", name=function_name, content=function_result, tool_call_id=tool_call.id))\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"response = client.chat(model=model, messages=messages)\\n\",\n+    \"response.choices[0].message.content\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"## Chat in a chain (cleaner user experience)\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": null,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"messages = []\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"while True:\\n\",\n+    \"    input_ = input(\\\"Ask: \\\")\\n\",\n+    \"    messages.append(ChatMessage(role=\\\"user\\\", content=input_))\\n\",\n+    \"    response = client.chat(model=model, messages=messages, tools=tools, tool_choice=\\\"auto\\\")\\n\",",

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

In particular, Mixtral displays a superior performance in code and mathematics benchmarks. Size and Efficiency. We compare our performance to the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mixtral models\u00e2 efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure 3). As a sparse Mixture- of-Experts model, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters for each token. With 5x lower active parameters, Mixtral is able to outperform Llama 2 70B across most categories. Note that this analysis focuses on the active parameter count (see Section 2.1), which is directly proportional to the inference compute cost, but does not consider the memory costs and hardware utilization.\\n\",\n+      \"--------------------------------------------------\\n\",\n+      \"ID: MjMxMC4wNjgyNSMx\\n\",\n+      \"Arxiv ID: 2310.06825\\n\",\n+      \"Title: Mistral 7B\\n\",\n+      \"Score: 0.7815856\\n\",\n+      \"Content: Mistral 7B outperforms the previous best 13B model (Llama 2, [26]) across all tested benchmarks, and surpasses the best 34B model (LLaMa 34B, [25]) in mathematics and code generation. Furthermore, Mistral 7B approaches the coding performance of Code-Llama 7B [20], without sacrificing performance on non-code related benchmarks. Mistral 7B leverages grouped-query attention (GQA) [1], and sliding window attention (SWA) [6, 3]. GQA significantly accelerates the inference speed, and also reduces the memory requirement during decoding, allowing for higher batch sizes hence higher throughput, a crucial factor for real-time applications. In addition, SWA is designed to handle longer sequences more effectively at a reduced computational cost, thereby alleviating a common limitation in LLMs. These attention mechanisms collectively contribute to the enhanced performance and efficiency of Mistral 7B.

In particular, Mixtral displays a superior performance in code and mathematics benchmarks. Size and Efficiency. We compare our performance to the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mixtral models\u00e2 efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure 3). As a sparse Mixture- of-Experts model, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters for each token. With 5x lower active parameters, Mixtral is able to outperform Llama 2 70B across most categories. Note that this analysis focuses on the active parameter count (see Section 2.1), which is directly proportional to the inference compute cost, but does not consider the memory costs and hardware utilization.\\n\",\n+      \"--------------------------------------------------\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"def generate_query_embedding(query):\\n\",\n+    \"    # Set the embedding model\\n\",\n+    \"    embed_model = \\\"mistral-embed\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"    # Generate embedding for the query\\n\",\n+    \"    embed = mistral.embeddings(model=embed_model, input=[query])\\n\",\n+    \"    return embed.data[0].embedding\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"# Pure Vector Search\\n\",\n+    \"query = \\\"can you tell me about mistral LLM?\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"vector_query = VectorizedQuery(\\n\",\n+    \"    vector=generate_query_embedding(query), k_nearest_neighbors=3, fields=\\\"embedding\\\"\\n\",\n+    \")\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"results = search_client.search(\\n\",\n+    \"    search_text=query,\\n\",\n+    \"    vector_queries=[vector_query],\\n\",\n+    \"    select=[\\\"id\\\", \\\"arxiv_id\\\", \\\"title\\\", \\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    top=3 # Limit the number of results\\n\",\n+    \")\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"for result in results:\\n\",\n+    \"    print(f\\\"ID: {result['id']}\\\")\\n\",\n+    \"    print(f\\\"Arxiv ID: {result['arxiv_id']}\\\")\\n\",\n+    \"    print(f\\\"Title: {result['title']}\\\")\\n\",\n+    \"    print(f\\\"Score: {result['@search.score']}\\\")\\n\",\n+    \"    print(f\\\"Content: {result['content']}\\\")\\n\",\n+    \"    print(\\\"-\\\" * 50)\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"## Ground retreived results from Azure AI Search to Mistral-Large LLM\"",

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",",

Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Antoine Roux, Arthur Mensch, Blanche Savary, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Emma Bou Hanna, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Bour, Guillaume Lample, L\u00c3\u00a9lio Renard Lavaud, Lucile Saulnier, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Sandeep Subramanian, Sophia Yang, Szymon Antoniak, Teven Le Scao, Th\u00c3\u00a9ophile Gervet, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Timoth\u00c3\u00a9e Lacroix, William El Sayed Abstract We introduce Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model. Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B \u00e2 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u00e2 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\\n\",\n+       \" 'prechunk_id': '',\\n\",\n+       \" 'postchunk_id': '2401.04088#1',\\n\",\n+       \" 'arxiv_id': '2401.04088',\\n\",\n+       \" 'references': ['1905.07830']}\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 30,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data[0]\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"Format the data into the format we need, this will contain `id`, `title`, `content` (which we will embed), and `arxiv_id`.\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n+   \"execution_count\": 33,\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"outputs\": [\n+    {\n+     \"name\": \"stderr\",\n+     \"output_type\": \"stream\",\n+     \"text\": [\n+      \"Map: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 13667.24 examples/s]\\n\"\n+     ]\n+    },\n+    {\n+     \"data\": {\n+      \"text/plain\": [\n+       \"Dataset({\\n\",\n+       \"    features: ['id', 'title', 'content', 'arxiv_id'],\\n\",\n+       \"    num_rows: 10000\\n\",\n+       \"})\"\n+      ]\n+     },\n+     \"execution_count\": 33,\n+     \"metadata\": {},\n+     \"output_type\": \"execute_result\"\n+    }\n+   ],\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"data = data.map(lambda x: {\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"id\\\": x[\\\"id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"title\\\": x[\\\"title\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"content\\\": x[\\\"content\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"arxiv_id\\\": x[\\\"arxiv_id\\\"],\\n\",\n+    \"})\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data = data.remove_columns([\\n\",\n+    \"    \\\"prechunk_id\\\", \\\"postchunk_id\\\", \\\"references\\\"\\n\",\n+    \"])\\n\",\n+    \"\\n\",\n+    \"data\\n\"\n+   ]\n+  },\n+  {\n+   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+   \"metadata\": {},\n+   \"source\": [\n+    \"We need to define an embedding model to create our embedding vectors for retrieval, for that we will be using Mistral AI's `mistral-embed`.

Is it really cheaper or/and better than just generating with mistral large directly a dataset without a Judge? I do understand that for DPO you are required to have two possible answers and get the best one, but will this dataset be better than one generated directly by Large?",

Could you help update the following:\r\n- Add title, headers, and more descriptions to the notebook, so that people can read the text and follow along. Right now, it is not clear what this notebook is about.\r\n- Could you download the Wikipedia pages via code instead of saving all the text in the data folder?  \r\n- Could you use the Mistral API endpoints?\r\n- Finally, could you make sure it's runnable on Colab?\r\n\r\nThanks!
